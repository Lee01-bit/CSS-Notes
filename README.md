CSS Notes

Writing a class selector

You can assign classes to HTML elements to create a reference point for styling. A class is an attribute that can be added to any HTML element, providing additional details about that element.In CSS, we use a dot (.) before the class name to differentiate it from HTML element selectors. Write ".intro" and set the color to green.

CSS has two parts: 

The selector. 
The declaration block. 

The selector specifies a pattern in the HTML, and if the pattern matches, the styles within the declaration block are applied to the corresponding HTML elements. It is possible to have multiple styles applied to the same pattern, and that is where the cascading part of CSS comes into play

  In CSS, each style declaration consists of two parts: 

A property. 
A value. 

Css comments are different to HTMl comments whereas it uses a slash and a star and a start and a slash "/* */"

Formatting color in CSS

The most common way to represent colors online is through hex codes, also known as hex values or hex format. Hex is short for hexadecimal.

 the last number (e.g., "CC" in the hex value or "0.8" in the RGB value) corresponds to Alpha, which relates to the opacity and transparency of the color.
